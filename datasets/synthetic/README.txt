Synthetic dataset
-----------------

1. Edit gen_ridge_data.py to change hardcoded
   constants like number of datapoints.

2. Run 'gen_ridge_data.py', which prints to stdout, and save
   results to a text file such as dataset.txt. On Linux:

      $ python3 gen_ridge_data.py > dataset.txt

3. Run ridge regression experiments on that dataset file.
